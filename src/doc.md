### What is ThetAR exchange?

ThetAR exchange is a fully decentralized exchange application hosted on Arweave blockchain developed by mARsLab.

Not only the smart contract code, but all front-end code and icons are permanently stored on Arweave blockchain.

ThetAR exchange is built on top of Warp contract protocol, which ensures the real-time of token trade.

As long as your token follows the [WRC-20](https://github.com/warp-contracts/wrc) specification, it can be [added to exchange](#/addPair). Token security is vetted by the contract code.

### What is $TAR token?

\$TAR token is the profit sharing token of ThetAR exchange. Anyone who holds the $TAR token(s) can obtain the transaction fee of the exchange according to the token holding ratio.

\$TAR token(s) can be obtained from within the dApp's [faucet tab](#/faucet).

### About transaction fee

For every transaction you create on the exchange (when you click the `create orker` button), we charge a fixed 0.01 $AR token as a transaction fee. Transaction fees will be distributed to $TAR token holders in accordance with standard Arweave community profit sharing rules.

### About pair adding fee
